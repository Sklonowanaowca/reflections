How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Diff command shows differences between two files and we can see which and how many lines was inserted or deleted.
	In the settings we can set the colours and see changes in files coloured in green (inserted) and red (deleted).

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can go back to the previous version and fix my problem. I don't have to ook for the bug many hours.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually commits are good if we can to decide if it is good time to do commit. Automatic commits are good because 
	we don't have to think about commits and there is no risk that we don't do the commit for a week.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is program which is mostly using to writing code what means that one project contains many files related
	to others. It is important to save all changes in all files. For document files wich are mostly storing on Google Drive
	there is no matter if we can saving multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    command 'git log' shows us all commits and every commit has unique ID, tittle, author and date. 'git diff' help	us
	to compare two commits shows in red line which was deleted and line which was inserted in green.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Command 'git checkout' let me restore previous version of my project many times (while previous versions exists)
	and check if that version of code is correct.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I am working on AndroidStudio project. I am writing an mobile application which will help people to organise their
	shopping lists.
